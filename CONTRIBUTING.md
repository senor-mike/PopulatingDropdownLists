# How to contribute

Thanks for taking an interest in this project. The authors hope the code in this repository and the accompanying article on [PluralSight Hack.Guides](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides) is helpful to you on your path toward greater proficiency as a developer.

* See the [Readme](Readme.md) file for information about the article(s) associated with this repository.

* If you have a suggestion to make the code more useful, and that suggestion takes the form of *code*, see the section on [Making Changes](#making-changes).

* If you believe you have found a bug in the code, please check to see if it has previously been reported by searching for it on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/ajsaulsberry/BlipAjax/issues) before opening a new issue or making changes.

## Reporting issues

Keep in mind that the intended use of the GitHub issue tracker for this repository is to report, discuss, and eliminate bugs in the existing code. It is not for:

* Requesting help implementing or modifying the code

* Reporting problems or asking questions about the article based on the code. (Use the Disqus commenting section below the article for that.)

### Making changes

Keep in mind that the code in the **master** branch of the repository is used in the text of the accompanying article on PluralSight. There is no automatic link between the repository and the article, so changes to the repository that effect code used in the article will necessitate manual changes to the article as well. Such changes may in turn effect the relevance of the code to the content of the article. Exercise restraint.

* If you are new to contributing to open source projects, kindly read the exellent [Open Source Contribution Etiquette](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.htm) by Miguel de Icaza.

* Fork the code and create a topic branch off **master** for your changes.

* Make commits to your local repo and sync them with the origin repo on GitHub.

  * Commit messages should be 72 characters or less, optionally followed by a blank line and a description of the commit if more information is appropriate.

* Send a pull request for your proposed changes.

  * Mention @ajsaulsberry in your pull request to have your proposed changes reviewed.

* Do not create a pull request solely for the purpose of updating NuGet packages or other dependencies.
